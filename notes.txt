open a terminal in the server directory
type "start rmiregistry &", a new window will open, leave this open
now type "java FrontEnd" in the terminal, this will launch the frontend server and connect it to the registry
now you can create as many replicas as you want, each in a new terminal window by typing "java Replica n" (with n being a unique number specified by you), each Replica will automatically join the registry and one of them will be assigned as the primary replica
you can also start the client by opening a new terminal window from the client directory and typing "java Client".
if this does not work, you will need to compile NewUserInfo and all of the Auction related classes and drag an instance of each to the client directory.
